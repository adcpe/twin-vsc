# Twin Themes for VSCode & VSCodium

The original idea for Twin is that of two color themes that share a similar color palette but use it in a different way. Over time, the idea shifted a bit.

Both themes have overlapping colors, but use different shades in places to differentiate themselves.

**Black** feels cozy. It uses dimmed colors to create a minimal environment.

**Blue** uses vibrant colors and the contrast between them to make it easier to grok blocks of code.

The goal is that both can be used all day long without discomfort.

## Acknowledgements

I wanted to create a theme for a long time, but I didn't know how to do it or how it would look.

Inspiration has been drawn from many places: [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl&WT.mc_id=twitter-social-sdras), [Halcyon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brittanychiang.halcyon-vscode), [Ayu](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu), and many more.

**Enjoy!**
